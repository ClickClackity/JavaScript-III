/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding: Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of this inside of that function will be the window object. 
* 2. Implicit binding: Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.
* 3. New binding: Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
* 4. explicit binding: Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

// Principle 4

// code example for Explicit Binding
